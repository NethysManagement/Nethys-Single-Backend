# Nethys

Nethys is an application to assist players playing Pathfinder 1st Edition. Currently, there is only 1 application that manages player information and dynamically assists players in score calculations, keeping track of spells, hit points, etc. This other application also has a fairly steep learning curve, requires a subscription, and is a downloaded application. Nethys, in contrast, will provide a free web application for players to track their characters that is easy to learn and use.

Nethys can be thought of as a Pathfinder version of D&D Beyond (<https://www.dndbeyond.com/>) with initial focus on spell casters. Initially, Nethys will allow a player to pick their class and level, and then track their spells and the ability to cast those spells. The goal is a surface level abstraction of those complications, while allowing the players to still be able to understand where the numbers come from. Outside of the previously mentioned application, there's not much support for Pathfinder today and we believe Nethys will make the game more approachable for new and veteran players.
